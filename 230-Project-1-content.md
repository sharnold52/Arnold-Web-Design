# I. High Concept #
A platformer where the player must use magic to 
create platforms and solve puzzles
	
# II. Genre #
Platformer with puzzle elements.
	
# III. Platform #
Desktop only. Mouse and keyboard are kind of necessarry.
	
# IV. Story #
The game does not have a big focus on story. There is a
loose narrative about an evil wizard that you must stop
using magic and solving puzzles.
	
# V. Aesthetics #
It will be a cartoon art style, or at least an attempt at one. This is really dependent upon my 
art skills. It will probably be a pixelated style, like the gifs I link below in screenshots.
Sound: 8-bit would probably work the best for this. Simple 
sound effects for jumping, maybe nature sounds since 
I would most likely have the setting be outdoors.
	
# VI. Gameplay #
Mechanics: The player can jump from platform to platform. 
When a platform is not close enough to the player, they 
can scroll over it and force it to expand. This maybe 
could also be used to push stuff like crates off of other
platforms.

Controls: WASD for movement. S crouch, W Jump. Space 
could also be bound to jumping. Mouse to scroll over 
platforms and click to perform magic.

Teaching the game: A simple set of signs posted next 
to the player on the first level to teach them the
controls.

Player Learning: The player needs to learn how to use 
"magic" to expand objects in the game to solve various
puzzles. On some levels, there may be an external force 
that forces the players to do this faster.
	
# VII. Screenshots #
Umm... no game yet, but here is a possible style for the 
type of graphics I would be going for.

These are animations I made for another project, 
but I feel like the art-style would work here as well.

# VIII. Other #
I would like to add more abilities, but I also am not really
sure what is feasible yet.
