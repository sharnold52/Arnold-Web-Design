# I. High Concept #
A platformer where the player must scroll over platforms 
to make them expand while avoiding traps.
	
# II. Genre #
Platformer with puzzle elements.
	
# III. Platform #
Desktop only. Mouse and keyboard are kind of necessarry.
	
# IV. Story #
Not really much to talk about here... maybe I could make 
something up about the player being a wizard trying to stop 
snowmen from taking over... I don't know. Nothing serious 
obviously.
	
# V. Aesthetics #
Cartoonish art style... that is really dependent upon my 
art skills. Maybe go with pixelated
Sound: 8-bit would probably work the best for this. Simple 
sound effects for jumping, maybe nature sounds since 
I would most likely have the setting be outdoors.
	
# VI. Gameplay #
Mechanics: The player can jump from platform to platform. 
When a platform is not close enough to the player, they 
can scroll over it and force it to expand. This maybe 
could also be used to push stuff like crates off of other
platforms.

Controls: WASD for movement. S crouch, W Jump. Space 
could also be bound to jumping. Mouse to scroll over 
platforms and click to perform magic.

Teaching the game: A simple set of signs posted next 
to the player on the first level to teach them the
controls.

Player Learning: The player needs to learn how to use 
"magic" to expand objects in the game to solve various
puzzles. On some levels, there may be an external force 
that forces the players to do this faster.
	
# VII. Screenshots #
Umm... no game yet, but here is a possible style for the 
type of graphics I would be going for.

These are animations I made for another project, 
but I feel like the art-style would work here as well.

# VIII. Other #
I would like to add more abilities, but I also am not really
sure what is feasible yet. Other abilities might be the ability
to spawn monkeys.... they don't particularly do anything... 
they just sort of laugh at you.

Ok, but seriously I would like to maybe have platforms that 
randomly generate, an ability to cause a warp-field or something 
else that just sounds awesome.
